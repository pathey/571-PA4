Use:
python version == 3.12.3

Can be run with:
python3 PA4.py data1.txt [seed int]

python3 can be replaced with your python installation of choice, data1.txt can be replaced with a relevant input file, and [seed int] can be replaced with desired int.

The last algorithm (oracle) takes a bit longer to run than the other algorithms, though less than 30 seconds. This is due to poor optimization, but it is functioning correctly.
